# occupi
Room occupancy monitoring based on Raspberry Pi

## Project Objectives
- Create deployable raspberry pi systems that can detect room occupancy
- Have each system provide a way to request occupancy statistics
  and in particular current status of the room.
- Expose a way to request that a particular Pi notify you when a room
  becomes free, and keep requests on a que. For instance, when a group 
  of people have to share a single washroom.

## Streatch Goal
- Pi's monitor each other for resiliancy
- Made data accesible to support security or energy auditing
